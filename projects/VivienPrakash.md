## Project Description
This project aims to improve subtitled viewing experience of medias, via a tool that has the ability to make subtitles slowly fade away so you can't miss out on any information regardless of the subtitle speed.

## Project Findings
For this project, we have found that people generally dislike instrusive subtitles on their so we developed a tool that would make the previous subtitles from the VTT file slowly fade out as the next subtitle gets displayed right away. That way, regardless of the speed there is always time for the viewer to catch up and not miss on information without rewinding.
